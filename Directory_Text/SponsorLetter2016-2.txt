Dear University of Michigan Engineering Students:

Welcome to the 2016 SWE/TBP Engineering Career Fair; we are proud to sponsor such a terrific event!

Learning A-Z is an education technology publisher dedicated to expanding literacy through thoughtfully designed resources.  Learning A-Z was founded in 2002 by Bob Holl.  Bob is currently the president of the division and continues to have a great vision and direction for new products.  We believe that every student has untapped potential and offer 7 award-winning online products to help teachers help them get there.  Over 6 million students are using our products in over 500,000 classrooms and 175 countries around the world.

At Learning A-Z, you will help build software to deliver award-winning content and functionality to students and teachers.  We work in an agile environment, releasing our software every month alongside new content.  You will work in all areas of development, up and down the stack. We take pride in our development team and give everyone the opportunity to be a well-rounded developer.

We also have a robust internship program.  Each intern gets the benefit of one-on-one mentoring with a member of our senior staff.  This personal attention ensures that our interns have the best possible experience and learn great development practices.  Our interns work on real projects that get incorporated into our released software, often before the summer ends.

Stop by our booth to find out more information about us and how to join our team!
