Hey UMich Engineering students: 

We are Fidessa, an innovative tech company with a passion for delivering high performance solutions to the finance industry. We're looking for driven, passionate, and diverse engineering students like you to help us make an impact and create cutting edge applications used across the world. We know that the University of Michigan Engineering students are just that and that's why Fidessa is a proud sponsor of the 2015 SWE/TBP Engineering Career Fair!

We are a dynamic global company with over 15 offices worldwide. With continued commitment from our employees and customers, we offer unique access to the largest and most valuable trading community, from global institutions and investment banks to boutique brokers and niche hedge funds. Our advanced products and services cover the whole trading lifecycle, from low latency trading tools to settlement, compliance and risk management.

We are freethinking and do not believe in rigid structure or tight controls where these limit our ability to be innovative and adaptable. We recognize that a business is only as good as its people. To provide and build on our high-quality platform and services, we seek to employ only the best!

Do you think you have what it takes? If so, stop by the Fidessa booth at the Engineering Career Fair to speak with a Fidessa representative and take our Coding challenge. 

We look forward to seeing you there!
