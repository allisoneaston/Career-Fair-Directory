# Career-Fair Map/Directory
The career fair used to use a directory system. The code to generate the directory is included in case someone wants it for some reason but the code you will probably need will be in MapInfo.

# Required Software
1. Python 2.7. Python is an open source computer scripting language–kinda like Matlab, except less sucky. This can be downloaded from: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ 
2.	LaTeX, particularly XeLaTeX. LaTeX (pronounced Luh-tech) is an open source typesetting suite designed to streamline the creation of technical documents, books, etc. It’s main reason for use here is that it allows programmatic creation of documents, which is kind of the point here.For Windows I’d recommend the MikTeX distribution (http://miktex.org/2.9/setup). For Mac, use XeLaTeX.
