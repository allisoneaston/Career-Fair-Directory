# Career-Fair-Directory

# Preface
The Directory has long been a staple of the Career Fair. Samples exist back to the mid-90s—showing the development of the Directory since that time. As the number of companies has grown, the challenge of presenting the data to attendees in a usable, coherent manner has created a heavy burden on chairs and has led to problematic transcription errors, stemming from a variety of causes. In 2013 it was set about to create a simple tool that would take the registration data and assemble it into a usable directory, with minimal human intervention needed. To build on that the tool was expanded to further create the binder covers and a html table of company data. What follows is a user guide, with minimal technical guide interleaved. This should obviously be a living document that adapts to the growth of the tool over the years.


Required Software
1.	Python 2.7. Python is an open source computer scripting language–kinda like Matlab, except less sucky. This can be downloaded from: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/ 
2.	LaTeX, particularly XeLaTeX. LaTeX (pronounced Luh-tech) is an open source typesetting suite designed to streamline the creation of technical documents, books, etc. It’s main reason for use here is that it allows programmatic creation of documents, which is kind of the point here. This will depend slightly on what operating system you’re using, for Windows I’d recommend the MikTeX distribution (http://miktex.org/2.9/setup). For Mac, I’m not sure, but make sure that it supports XeLaTeX.
